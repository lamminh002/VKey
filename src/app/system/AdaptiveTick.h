// AdaptiveTick.h - idle cadence for MainThreadWorker.
// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-only
//
// Pure C++, Linux-portable. Maps "milliseconds since last user activity" to
// the MainThreadWorker tick interval. Used by HookEngine::OnTickPoll and
// HookEngine::RetuneCadenceIfNeeded.
//
// Two states only:
//   * Active / briefly paused (idle < kIdleStopThreshMs): tick at 200 ms. The
//     worker polls CJK layout (Win+Space), foreground PID, and the anti-Dorion
//     detector at this cadence — so a layout switch is caught within 200 ms
//     (the instant feel of the a8800b3f build).
//   * Deep idle (idle >= kIdleStopThreshMs): STOP (return 0). The owner maps 0
//     to SetTickInterval(0) → the worker blocks on cv_.wait (∞), touches no
//     pages, and Windows trims the working set (v2.1.24 idle parity). The next
//     keystroke resumes the cadence via HookEngine::MarkActivity → Signal.
//
// History: the 2026-05-27 "adaptive backoff" (200ms → 1s → 5s on idle) was
// REMOVED. It regressed CJK detection (Win+Space after a pause caught 1-5s
// late) for ZERO RAM benefit — touching pages every few seconds never lets the
// working set age out; only a full STOP does. See
// docs/plans/2026-05-30-idle-ram-investigation-summary.md.
